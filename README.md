## About Me

I am a software engineer focused on developing web applications with Web3 features integration. I have hands-on experience in smart contract development across multiple blockchains. 

My main stack includes React.js for front-end, Solidity or Rust for blockchain development, and Express.js or axum for back-end services.

## Areas of Experience

- Applications for assets tokenization;
- Smart contract managers and callers;
- On-chain development for DeFi use cases;
- Blockchain infrastructure tools;
- Websites for products, tools, companies, and developer platforms.

## Open Source

I've worked on several open source projects as part of engineering teams building Polkadot infrastructure.

- [OpenBrush](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts) - library for smart contract development;
- [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/Brushfam/sol2ink) - tool for migration from Solidity to Ink!;
- [LearnPage](https://learn.brushfam.io/) - technical documentation portal for some Polkadot tools.
